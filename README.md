Sega Paradise was created primarily out of my love for 16-bit gaming consoles. They remind me of a similar time in life. That being said, my favorite classic gaming console is the Sega Genesis. To this day, I still play a few of the games on my website. So it goes without saying that I absolutely adore what the Sega Genesis represented.

-You have the ability to view the games without logging in, but you must log in to add games to the list.

-You have total CRUD controls for both the account, as well as, the games (after sign up/sign in).

-The game covers utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS).

-The images in the carousel are all linked to various websites. This allows the user to easily interchange them without any hassle. The preferred resolution for these images is 480p (640 x 480).
